# Kalman Filter 

Situation covered: Simple example where you have an vehicle moving in one dimension and measure the position in the x-axis.

# Extended Kalman Filter with Constant Turn Rate and Acceleration (CTRA) Model

Situation covered: You have an acceleration and velocity sensor which measures the vehicle longitudinal acceleration and speed (v) in heading direction (ψ) and a yaw rate sensor (ψ˙) which all have to fused with the position (x & y) from a GPS sensor.
